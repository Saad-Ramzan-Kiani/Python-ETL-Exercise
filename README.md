A company wants to analyze its employees and customers together to gain insights on workforce distribution and customer engagement. The company has:
●	An employee dataset (CSV) containing HR data.

●	A customer dataset (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) with user details, including their company affiliation.

The goal is to integrate both datasets to determine:
●	How many employees work in customer companies?

●	Which departments have employees working with customer firms?

●	What is the salary distribution of employees in customer-affiliated companies?
